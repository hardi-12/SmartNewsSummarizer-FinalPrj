# SmartNewsSummarizer-FinalPrj

## Abstract
On a daily basis, we read multiple news articles, but a single news topic may not contain all of the relevant information. We can obtain useful information from the comprehensive articles, which will save us a lot of time and energy. Text summarization is a way of reducing a text to a meaningful summary while retaining the information content and overall meaning. This system will help us enhance the readability of a particular news article without missing any important points. Sentiment Analysis is performed on the summary to understand the sentiment of the news articles. Text classification is used to organize, structure, and categorize different types of news articles.
In this, we generate the summaries using the Text Rank algorithm along with text classification using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Classifier, Decision tree Classifier, K Nearest Neighbour, and Gaussian Naive Bayes models and evaluate the performance of the above-mentioned models using precision, recall, f1 score, and accuracy score on the BBC news dataset.
